When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For sharing/collaborations, for access from multiple machines, and to save work in case of local hard drive failure.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To keep new changes isolated for testing and not introduce other variables locally that you didn't count on.
