What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder is created for the metadata, and git looks to see what files are available to commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an area to temporarily store files until you are ready to commit them all together. It 
provides the ability to package or group like changes prior to the commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Only add the files you want to commit and verify what is in the staging area with the git status command.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches could be used for individual projects or for specific requirements. This would allow testing of individual
changes independently of each other.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It helps understand the lineage of the changes and which changes will be shown in the log.
